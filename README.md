Steps to make the app run better:

1.remain the reducer as pure functions-
how? make all the impure actions , in the actions.

2.Divied the the action in to smaller function for 2 reasons:
a. DRY code
b. so when I search, i will not execute the first autoComlete function twice.

3.Learn useRef, useParams, and deBounce with useRef.

4.Complete (after I learns useParams hook) get back to location i Liked.

5.try to divide the logics from Search and homepage.

<!-- 6.Divide the reducers into 2 seperates files; -->
